# Window management guidelines

- Shortcuts should work the same on all operating systems, if possible.

## Modifier key

ALt + Super is used as modifier.

- It is unique enough to not be used by other programs.

- The 2 keys are next to each other and on the same spot (though not same order) on linux (super, alt), windows (win, alt), and macos (alt, cmd).

- The keys are easy to hit even when not using a keyboard with a dedicated alt+super key.

- The combination can be expanded with shift for similar actions.

## Shortcuts

When using the internal keyboard, the modifier is pressed with the left hand. Therefore, most common shortcuts use the right hand.

See excel file for actual shortcuts.
